    <div class="steps max-length">
      <h4 class="text-center">STEP ONE</h4>
      <p>Your application will undergo an initial review by a LOYAL volunteer and is assigned to a screener. Within a few days of sending in your application, a LOYAL volunteer will be in touch with you to set up a telephone interview. This interview lasts 30-60 minutes.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">STEP TWO</h4>
      <p>Your references - both veterinarian and personal will be contacted. The volunteer will then submit a report to the LOYAL adoptions committee. Once the results of the interview are in, and positive, LOYAL will request that a home visit be done.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">STEP THREE</h4>
      <p>Depending on your location, the home visit may occur within days of the interview, or weeks later. If there are no LOYAL volunteers locally, we will request assistance from other rescue groups affiliated with us. Rescue work is largely volunteer based and many people have family obligations beyond rescue which might limit their immediate availability to conduct the visit.</p>
