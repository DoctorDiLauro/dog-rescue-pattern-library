        <p class="max-length">Loyal believes that we have a duty to ensure that our dogs are placed in the homes best suited for them, with applicants that believe in the philosophy of rescue and have the patience to work through the screening process. The application provides some of the detail needed to make this determination. Certainly it is easier to walk into the store and buy a puppy because of the "instant gratification", but adopting a dog is a lifetime commitment, not something to take lightly. We go through this process to make sure that the fit is right, the dog is ready and you are the best home for them.
