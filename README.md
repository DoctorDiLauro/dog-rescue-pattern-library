fonts:
  primary: |
    The primary typeface is an easily readable font at many different sizes. A serif was chosen to convey a more serious tone.

    Use the primary typeface for body copy, lists, information that is smaller on the page, or text that has a high amount of words.
  secondary: |
    The secondary typeface is a bold, geometric sans-serif. It contrasts the primary, and maintains the tone while adding a sleek and modern twist.

    Use the secondary typeface for headings, buttons, and important, short bits of info in the form section.
colors:
  primary: |
    The primary colour reflects the serious tone of the nature of the fostering system. It is heavy, and a little sombre, but somewhat comforting and relaxing. Use the primary for the nav, and anything directly associated with the brand.
  secondary: |
    The secondary acts as a darker version of the primary to add some contrast. Use this for body copy, and smaller headings.
  neutral: |
    The neutral colours are for backgrounds, and inner page headings.
